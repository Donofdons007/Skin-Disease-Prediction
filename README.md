# Skin-Disease-Prediction
The skin disease prediction project leverages deep learning concepts to accurately predict various skin diseases. By analyzing images of skin conditions, the project employs sophisticated neural networks to learn patterns and identify specific diseases. 
The Proposed methodology is an effective tool which can analyze the people input skin disease to predict skin disease. In this proposed system, hybrid architecture with image processing and machine learning techniques are used to predict type of disease with promising accuracy in a short period of time.
